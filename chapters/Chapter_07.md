# Chapter 7: Web Development Overview

The web once served as humanity's great meeting ground—a boundless space where creativity flourished and communities thrived. In this chapter, we explore the craft of web development, piecing together the languages and frameworks that shaped online experiences. Even as the digital landscape lies fractured, these tools offer pathways to rebuild communication and share knowledge across scattered settlements.

We revisit the fundamentals of HTML and CSS, foundations of structure and style. JavaScript brought interactivity to static pages, transforming the web into a dynamic platform. Server-side technologies—from PHP to Node.js—enabled complex applications that once fueled commerce and social networks. Each layer of the stack reveals how collaboration and innovation changed the world.

Modern frameworks streamlined development and encouraged responsive design, ensuring sites adapted gracefully to screens large and small. Yet the philosophical roots of the web run deeper: it was conceived as an open forum, a decentralized network of information accessible to anyone. In the aftermath of decline, we consider how to honor that spirit while guarding against misuse and ensuring security.

Through web development, we rekindle the dream of a connected society. By mastering these techniques, we breathe life into digital communities that can survive even in the harshest of post-apocalyptic realities.
