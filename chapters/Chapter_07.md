# Chapter 7: Web Development Overview

The web rose from the ashes of fragmented knowledge networks to become a unifying platform. In a world of uncertainty, it provides a means to share information widely and rapidly. This chapter explores how to craft resilient websites and applications that endure when resources are scarce.

We begin with the building blocks: HTML gives structure, CSS imparts style, and JavaScript breathes interactivity into pages. These technologies form the foundation for user experiences that remain accessible even under constrained circumstances.

Server-side development extends functionality with databases, authentication, and dynamic content. We discuss lightweight frameworks that simplify deployment and emphasize the importance of efficient code, mindful that bandwidth and processing power may be limited.

Modern practices such as responsive design ensure that sites adapt to the myriad devices still in circulation. We highlight how caching and content delivery networks can improve performance, preserving user access when infrastructure fluctuates. By mastering these principles, developers can create web resources that help communities thrive despite a tumultuous environment.
