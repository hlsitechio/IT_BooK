# Chapter 10: Cloud Computing Fundamentals

Amid the ashes of collapsed infrastructure, the dream of elastic resources lives on in cloud computing. This chapter charts the rise of on-demand services that once freed organizations from the constraints of physical hardware. We examine the service models—Infrastructure as a Service, Platform as a Service, Software as a Service—and reflect on how they transformed industries with unprecedented flexibility.

Deployment options shaped the strategies of the old world. Public clouds offered scalability but required trust in distant providers. Private clouds granted greater control, at the cost of higher complexity. Hybrid and multi-cloud solutions emerged to balance these trade-offs, weaving resilience into the fabric of IT. In the current era, survivors adopt whichever approach suits their scarce resources and uncertain futures.

We also contemplate the philosophical implications of outsourcing critical infrastructure. How did reliance on vast remote data centers shift power dynamics and reshape economies? What lessons can we draw from the sudden failures that rippled through cloud-dependent systems during the fall? These questions guide our exploration of best practices, from cost management to automation and orchestration.

Though the horizon appears bleak, cloud computing holds potential for rebirth. By harnessing shared resources, communities can rebuild services without bearing the weight of dedicated hardware. This chapter invites readers to consider how the cloud might enable collaboration and innovation even in a world forever changed.
