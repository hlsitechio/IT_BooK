# Chapter 9: Data Science Basics

In the ruins of collapsed systems, data becomes a compass guiding decisions for recovery. This chapter surveys the methods by which raw information is transformed into actionable insight. We explore statistical principles, programming techniques, and the human intuition that binds them.

Data analysis begins with collection and cleaningâ€”tasks that require patience and rigor. We discuss how to curate datasets that may originate from incomplete records or disparate sources. Tools such as Python and R provide flexible environments for manipulating this data, allowing analysts to uncover trends and anomalies.

Machine learning offers a means to predict outcomes when patterns are too complex for manual interpretation. We introduce supervised and unsupervised techniques, cautioning against blind reliance on algorithms that may carry hidden biases. Responsible use of predictive models can accelerate rebuilding efforts but must be tempered with ethical oversight.

Ultimately, data science is a fusion of mathematics, programming, and domain understanding. By cultivating these skills, readers gain the ability to illuminate the unknown and steer communities toward informed choices.
